'''
Parole system - you increase your bet after every win. 
For example, after you win the first game where you bet $15, you now bet $30. 
If you win the second game, you bet double or $60 on the third. 
However, if you win the third, you do not go $120 but down to the original $15 and 
start again, ensuring you never lose too much and walking away with hefty prize money.
